# events-ireckonu
A simple client-side app that lists events and shows details for every event.

Download or clone the repo and run `npm install`.

## Notes
I have added 2 new test events just so you can see that the grouping works correctly.

## Development server
Run `ionic serve --lab` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8100/ionic-lab`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ionic cordova build [<platform>]` to build the project. Use the `--prod --release` flags for a production build.
